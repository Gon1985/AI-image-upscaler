# AI-image-upscaler üë®‚Äçüíªüé® (Experimental)
Application that uses artificial intelligence to increase the resolution of images, making them larger while enhancing details and maintaining or improving image quality.


Key Components
------------------
Imports:

-torch: For neural network operations.

-PIL: For image processing.

-tkinter: For creating the GUI.

-threading & time: For managing and timing the process.

-Model Loading:
Loads a pre-trained RRDBNet model.

-Image Upscaling:
Processes the image to upscale its resolution.

-Processing Time Estimation:
Estimates the time required for upscaling.

-Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Provides an easy-to-use interface for users.


(Just a quick note: Keep in mind that this type of project demands a lot of resources at the hardware level, I recommend a powerful CPU and GPU.)
