# Basic AI-image-upscaler 👨‍💻🎨 (Experimental)
Application that uses artificial intelligence to increase the resolution of images, making them larger while enhancing details and maintaining or improving image quality.

🚨IMPORTANT🚨:
Please download the RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth file
(this is the link to download the file.)

and add it to the main folder, otherwise the program will not work.

Key Components
------------------
Imports:

-torch: For neural network operations.

-PIL: For image processing.

-tkinter: For creating the GUI.

-threading & time: For managing and timing the process.

-Model Loading:
Loads a pre-trained RRDBNet model.

-Image Upscaling:
Processes the image to upscale its resolution.

-Processing Time Estimation:
Estimates the time required for upscaling.

-Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Provides an easy-to-use interface for users.

This is an experimental project using ESRGAN. For more information, search its official repo.
🚧 Attention: Project results may vary.🚧
Just a quick note: Keep in mind that this type of project demands a lot of resources at the hardware level, I recommend a powerful CPU and GPU.
